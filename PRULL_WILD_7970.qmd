First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field.

I believe that the utilization of environmental DNA in aquatic systems for fish is one of the most groundbreaking and disruptive ideas in the fisheries field. It is a fairly recent discovery with the earliest uses of environmental DNA used for fisheries applications described by Jerde et al. 2011 (See full citation below). Before environmental DNA, fisheries professionals would have to resort to electrofishing, netting, etc. as indicators of whether species were present/not present, etc. However, for rare species, species that are in low abundance, or species that are not readily caught by traditional gears it was extremely non-practical to attempt to capture them. The only solution available before e-DNA was to increase the overall sampling effort. However, e-DNA has solved this problem and revolutionized the fisheries field. While environmental DNA had been utilized for the detection of species in a wide variety of other fields (birds, mammals, amphibians, etc.), Jerde et al. 2011 (to my knowledge) were the first people to demonstrate its use for fishes.

Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?

I am not aware of any truly ground-breaking or paradigm shifting work in the fisheries field over the past 5-10 years. However, one paper by Lackmann et al. 2019 did provide some fairly disruptive findings. Over the years we have utilized otoliths in the fisheries field to age fishes. It has been deemed a precise and accurate tool for this purpose. Lackmann somewhat shifted our views on this as he successfully discovered and validated that Bigmouth Buffalo could live well over 100 years old, making it the oldest known freshwater teleost fish. He validated his findings by utilizing carbon dating on Bigmouth Buffalo otoliths. While not truly paradigm shifting, his work set the stage for a re-evaluation of aging techniques as many slow growing fish may be much older than was previously thought. Should fish be older than previously described by literature, it would change how we manage for those species.

I personally feel that disruptiveness in the fisheries field has declined slightly over time. However, with the e-DNA example provided above, we are still discovering paradigm shifting work as recent as 14 years ago. I have confidence that we will continue to find paradigm shifting work in the fisheries field (even if the rate of paradigm shifting work has declined over time)

Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?

For the fisheries field we have always used high functioning statistical computing for most studies. SAS and more recently R have been the workhorses for our statistical computing needs. For spatial related studies (such as my thesis), ArcGIS and ArcGIS Pro are heavily used. Recently I learned how to use ArcGIS pro through the R interface which has made my data analysis much easier and I think that most fisheries professionals would benefit from learning how to use ArcGIS Pro through R. As far as data visualization and communication goes, most people in the fisheries field utilize power point presentations or posters. However, in a more public setting, fisheries professionals oftentimes use more simplified visual aids such as actual fish, pamphlets, etc.

I feel like there is minimal challenges associated with simpler tools such as powerpoint, however, there are some issues/challenges associated with high processing statistical software. Firstly, the learning curve is very large, so many people often get discouraged from using programs such as R. Additionally, as R packages are updated, strings of code that once ran correctly may not work years down the road. For my research I will be heavily focused on using R, ArcGISPro through the R interface, and powerpoint. I briefly learned about Google Earth Engine as a potential spatial tool but I don't believe I have the time to learn how to use such a tool. Perhaps it would be useful in the future.

We left a couple of questions open-ended in our class discussion today. Please write 2-3 paragraphs addressing how you would handle reviewers of your own manuscript that provide feedback that you simply disagree with and/or contradicts feedback from another reviewer.

Contradicting reviewers can be a very difficult hurdle in the publishing process. I have personally dealt with this for a paper I published from my undergraduate research. We had 3 reviewers for our manuscript. 2 of them provided very good critical feedback that was helpful in advancing our paper. 1 reviewer, however, was not so nice and essentially said that my paper was trash because my results did not perfectly match that of another study published a few years earlier. Because 2 out of 3 reviewers were essentially in agreement, we followed their constructive criticism and frankly ignored a lot of the feedback provided by the contradictory and unprofessional reviewer.

Should we have had only 2 reviewers with contradicting thoughts I am not sure how we would have approached it. We used majority rule to solve our problem, but that wouldn't be the case if you had 2 reviewers that were contradictory. I suppose the best course of action would have been to write a carefully crafted response to the reviewer who we didn't agree with and then take the constructive reviewers advice. I feel like when crafting the response you have to be very careful, because more likely than not the reviewer knows who you are. Thus, writing a response that is firm without coming across as a hothead is important. We wrote a fairly long response outlying why we weren't going to take the bad reviewers advice for my personal research, it was just easier to do because 2/3 reviewers were actually good reviewers and in agreement with each other.

Missed class

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In class we discussed challenges that can arise with collaborations, and Elijah pointed out that manuscript authorship is one place where collaborations can become particularly tricky to navigate. This writing prompt is based on a true story, but the names have been changed to protect the innocent.

Dr. Andrews develops an amazing research idea. She and her postdoc bring in 4 collaborators from other universities and they all work to write a proposal which is funded for almost 3 million dollars. From there, Dr. Andrews has almost nothing to do with the implementation of the project. Her postdoc handles the work in her lab, and the collaborators each hire graduate students to handle the work in their labs. Three years later, when all of the data have been collected, Dr. Andrews expects to be an author on every paper associated with this grant (the project was her idea after all), but this was NOT discussed ahead of time.

Pretend you are one of Dr. Andrews' collaborators. Would you agree to have her on every paper you and your graduate student publish from this grant? Do you think this is a reasonable request? Justify your answer, and discuss how you would handle discussing this with Dr. Andrews.

No I would not. I believe that Dr. Andrews should probably be an author on anything her postdoc publishes as she will likely have input/contribution inthe writing process. However, for the other published work from the other collaborators, I would not expect to be an author on their work. According to the prompt she has essentially nothing to do with their work. Perhaps she should expect to be in the acknowledgements but I believe authorship is a bit too much to ask.

I would sit down and discuss with Dr. Andrews that if she wants to be included as an author she needs to contribute to the writing of the manuscript. Just because you had a good idea doesn't mean you should be entitled to a bunch of publications without putting forth some effort. If she is not willing to help out, she will be acknowledged, but not be given authorship. I feel like in this scenario I would make it very clear and not sugarcoat anything. It sounds like she is already upset and being up front and honest would help avoid any future confusion. Dr. Andrews might not like the results but I feel like this is the only fair way to go about moving forward.

Sharing manuscripts on pre-print servers before they have been accepted by a journal has been touted as one means of advancing open science practices. Discuss some of the pros and cons of this practice and weigh in on whether you have tried or would try pre-printing your manuscripts in the future.

This is an interesting practice that I had not heard of before. I do believe that it could enhance open science as more information could be readily available at any given time. However, the issue of quality control remains a strong concern of mine for this practice. The journal review process is a great quality control method that rejects journals with obvious flaws that could potentially get published in a pre-print server. People could then cite or use this information without realizing that the pre-print paper has obvious flaws. Now, because I am unfamiliar with pre-print servers, perhaps there is some review process, however, I assume that it does not because then why would the author not submit to an actual journal.

While I do not foresee myself using a pre-print server, there could be some other benefits besides "advancing open science practices." Publishing in a legitimate journal is usually very expensive. I assume that publishing in a pre-print server would be much cheaper. So, if budgets are tight and maybe you cannot find the funding to publish your paper in a recognized journal, perhaps publishing in a pre-print server may be beneficial. It would allow you to still get your information out to other researchers, then, once you get the necessary funding, you could publish the same work in a journal. Or, simply if you are not interested in going through the publication process (which I have seen many grad students do), a pre-print server may ease your workload and allow that information to be utilized by other researchers. However, instead of the journal being the gatekeeper for quality control, it would be the responsibility of the reader to decipher any flaws that would make the information unusable.

Define a "ethical journal.

I believe that an ethical journal is a journal that does 2 things:

1.  I believe that an ethical journal needs to have quality peer review that also serves as quality control to ensure that published studies are being done in a proper manner. They need to make sure statistics are correct and that studies are not making claims that extend beyond their data/analyses. Additionally, the peer review process in itself should be rigorous and constructive.
2.  I also believe that an ethical journal shouldn't operate to such a degree that it keeps jacking up the prices to publish just because they can. I feel like there is a happy medium where journals can still make quite a bit of money, while making it financially reasonable to publish in their journal. I feel like we have seen the cost of publishing become inflated over my lifetime and I don't think that it will stop at this point. But, in my opinion, an ethical journal wouldn't just inflate costs of publishing just because they can.

You're at a holiday dinner, and you are discussing your thesis/dissertation with family around the table. Just as you finish describing your awesome statistical analysis that you worked super hard on, and telling everyone what it means for your results, one of your family members says "Isn't it true that you can kind of make statistics say anything?" Use our conversation from this week to formulate a response to this family member.

I believe that in theory you could make statistics say about anything. In class we talked about throwing everything at the wall and pumping up sample sizes to get a statistically "significant" result. However, I would have to explain to them that just because something is significant doesn't mean that in actuality that its meaningful at all. You need to be very careful how statistics are interpreted in an effort to lead people astray. Unfortunately, there a lots of places that bend statistics to their will to make headlines and get their 15 minutes of fame. That is likely what the family is likely talking about. So, I would be sure to explain to them how while there is some truth to what they are saying, as a reader, you need to be careful how you interpret reported statistics and need to be wary about the integrity of said statistics. Then, I would go on to explain that my results are important because we carefully used the proper tests, data collection methods, etc. in order to get a statistical result that is actually meaningful for my study.

Describe a citizen science project that could be applied to your research area. Outline the project's goals, the type of data participants would collect, and how it could advance your research. Briefly discuss the potential advantages of this approach, as well as possible pitfalls such as data quality, participant engagement, or logistical challenges.

Somebody in my lab did a research study looking at capture rates of fish in a reservoir. We tagged fish in the lake with dart tags that had a phone number for anglers to call and report their catch. While anglers were eventually paid for reporting the fish, they still had to voluntarily call us and do a survey that gave us helpful information for my lab-mate's study. Through this approach my lab-mate was able to look at capture rates, harvest rates, and post release mortality. All of this would be impossible without the citizen science approach.

Firstly, this approach does not allow for any bias in "simulated" fishing encounters. Past fishery studies have electrofished individuals and then expose them to "simulated" angling events and then look at things like post-release mortality. However, because my lab-mate relied on actual anglers catching fish there is no simulation element at all. Rather, the capture events are exactly how they would happen in the real world. Another benefit of this approach is that it would be next to impossible for managers to effectively evaluate capture rates of fish on a \>14000 acre lake. There is simply not enough time or money available to do such a thing without using citizen science.

One negative of the approach was non-reporting of tags. We ran into this issue even though anglers would be compensated for calling us and reporting the tag, there was still a decent amount of people who would not participate. Obviously, this could affect estimates in his analysis. Additionally, because we are relying on people to give us information, they may simply may mistakenly give us the wrong capture date, capture locations, etc. when undergoing the phone survey. However, despite these negatives, as I previously stated, there is not really an alternative way to answer the study objectives of my lab mates study without the use of citizen science.
